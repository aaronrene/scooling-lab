# Governance sync skill

Use when a session is ending, handover/roadmap may be stale, or the operator runs `/governance-sync`.

## Purpose

Keep `{{docs.roadmap_path}}` and `{{docs.handover_path}}` aligned with true VCS state and phase
truth. This automates the SD-17 obligation — it does not invent new policy.

## Read first

- `{{docs.handover_path}}` — current NEXT block
- `{{docs.roadmap_path}}` — build status table
- `policy/tiers.yaml`, `policy/model-labels.yaml`
- `.overseer/config.yaml` — regime and doc paths

## Workflow (docs-first)

1. Read VCS status via the kit adapter for **`{{vcs.regime}}`** (fail-closed on read errors).
2. Compare docs to reality; list drift (phase status, branch/sha, NEXT prompt staleness).
3. Update `{{docs.roadmap_path}}` first.
4. Regenerate `{{docs.handover_path}}` from updated roadmap + VCS snapshot.
5. Include **`Model:`** on every NEXT block per `policy/model-labels.yaml`.
6. If NEXT is **Thinking → Auto**, emit `{step}a` or `{step}b` only — not both unless `{step}a` incomplete.

## CLI (when K4/K5 land)

```bash
/path/to/overseer-kit/cli/ok governance-sync --dry-run
/path/to/overseer-kit/cli/ok governance-sync
```

**Default: dry-run.** Writes nothing except the local `.overseer/last_governance_sync`
marker when D1/D2 are aligned (GFG carve-out). Governance-doc patches, commits, and
realign apply only on explicit non-dry-run; never on `{{vcs.git.main_branch}}`.

After apply/write of living docs, run `ok next` (or equivalent Read) and include the
`## CURRENT NEXT — paste this` heading+fence in the user-visible close.

## Post-merge land closeout (PMHF)

When the handover NEXT is `land-phase=land-a` and D1 is drifted (the merge landed on
`{{vcs.git.main_branch}}`), the plan emits the **land-b** paste for the same slice.
land-b required: `ok governance-sync --dry-run` then apply; paste land-b; do not re-paste land-a.

## Closing commit

Feature branch only. Message pattern: `governance: sync handover + roadmap (<date>)`. Bundle both docs.

## Hard stops

- No merge to `{{vcs.git.main_branch}}` without Tier 3
- No staging push without Tier 3
- No live posture flips
- No peer-repo writes from this command — workspace relay check is read-only (§MR.8)

## Multi-repo (when `workspace:` configured)

After advancing product_order PRIMARY, refresh each `relay: true` tip
(`role=relay` or `## PRODUCT RELAY —`) and run:

```bash
ok workspace check-next
```

`governance-sync` footer / JSON key `workspace_relay` reports
`not_configured|ok|stale_relay|ambiguous_primary|missing_member|error`. Multi-repo SD-17
is incomplete until `check-next` exits `0`. Single-repo docs↔VCS sync remains required.
